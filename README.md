### Verifying Schedules: EventBridge Rules
Now that Terraform has deployed our EventBridge rules, itâ€™s essential to confirm their configuration directly in the AWS Management Console. This step verifies that our schedules are correctly set up and understand how their UTC-based cron expressions translate to our desired local times.

- Observe the schedule_expression: You will see cron(0 3 ? * MON-FRI *).
- Understand the Time Translation: This cron expression specifies 03:00 AM UTC. Given that Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) is UTC+5, this translates to 8:00 AM PKT (03:00 UTC + 5 hours = 08:00 PKT). This confirms our instance will be scheduled to start at the beginning of the workday, Monday through Friday.
